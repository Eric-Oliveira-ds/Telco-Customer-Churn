# Telco-Customer-Churn
This project on GitHub, "Telco Customer Churn", aims to predict whether a telecom customer is tolerating churn. The sorting machine learning model is trained on historical customer data and uses that data to predict whether a customer is tolerant of leaving or not.

The financial impact of this model for the telecom company is significant. By identifying tolerant customers to leave early, the company can take steps to retain these customers, which can result in significant cost savings. The model can be used to calculate return on investment (ROI) in terms of cost savings, which helps to assess their financial impact to the business.

The development team for this project provided a Python function to calculate the model's ROI, using measures such as recall to assess the model's effectiveness. The function returns the ROI in reals, representing how much money the model brings to the company.

Overall, this project is a valuable solution for telcos that want to identify customers they tolerate leaving early and take steps to retain them. With its financial impact clearly defined, it is a powerful tool to help a company maximize its return on investment.

In addition, the model performed impressively in identifying customers likely to leave. ``In the test set, there were 210 customers who were churn and the model was able to correctly identify 162 of them. With these accurate forecasts, it was possible to reduce costs for the company. In detail, these 210 churn customers brought a cost of BRL 22.471,91, but with the correct predictions made by the model, it was possible to reduce these costs to BRL 3.38 (99,98%)``. This is clear evidence of the effectiveness of the model and its significant financial impact for the telecom company.
